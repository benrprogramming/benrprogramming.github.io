									<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
									<p>I've been playing Games since I was old enough to pick up a controller and have wanted to develop them for even longer. I am currently on my first year of Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University. I've worked on multiple solo and group projects during my previous college course and I am now working on more advanced projects at University. I will post about these projects and any new exciting opportunities on this portfolio.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Rhythm</h2>
									<p><strong>Rhythm</strong> is my best piece of work to date. Rhythm is a group project in which I lead the programming side of development. It was built using C# and the Unity Engine. The game is based around the motif of music and has a emphasis on playability. If you would like to play Rhythm please download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ENbxJAOg3ZKzm7mJuyQzVk5uj8q6_Pek">here</a>.</p>
