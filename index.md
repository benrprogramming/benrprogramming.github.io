## Rhythm
Rhythm is a side-scrolling survival game where the player must try and work their way through two, tight and winding levels.

Will you feel the Rhythm or fall out of the Flow?

Rhythm was created as a group project during my College course, I worked as the Lead Programmer and utilised C# and the Unity engine to build Rhythm.
